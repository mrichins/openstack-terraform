## Getting Started:

First you gotta export the following variables correctly just to make sure you're not exposing secrets in your publicly facing code: (if you would rather keep all the code in Terraform, you can follow the format described on (Terraform's documentation)[https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html])

`export OS_USERNAME="(YOUR USERNAME)"`
`export OS_PASSWORD="(YOUR PASSWORD)"`
`export OS_TENANT_NAME="(YOUR PROJECT/TENANT NAME)"`
`export OS_TENANT_ID="(YOUR PROJECT ID)"`
